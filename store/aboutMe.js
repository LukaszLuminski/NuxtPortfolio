    description: '<p>I have always been interested in IT and art, although for years I treated those only as a hobby.<br> By profession, I was an English teacher in my home country of Poland, but the low wage forced me to seek other options.</p><p>At first I studied laptops troubleshooting, to get myself a technical support job in Germany. Due to personal circumstances, I changed my plans and have eventually moved to the UK.</p><p>Here I started studying installing and maintaining small networks. After a year I realized it had not been a good choice. I wanted to find a role within IT, which would allow me to use more of my creativity and an eye for detail. I tried coding and it has quickly become my passion.</p><p>Since 2019 I was working on various projects, dividing my time between them and a full time job, preparing for a career change.</p><p>In June 2020 I have started working as a Front End Web Developer. I have been working mostly with Vue.js since, growing passionate about this JS framework and its libraries, which let me quickly create unique UI for our clients.</p><p>In my private life I am a happy husband and a father. I love drawing, reading books and travelling. I also go to the gym, cycle and swim in my free time.</p>'
